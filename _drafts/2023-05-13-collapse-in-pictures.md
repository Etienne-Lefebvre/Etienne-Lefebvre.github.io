# What Fuels our Civilization

Energy. 
![Population + Fossil fuel energy](\img\posts\world-population-and-fuel-use.png)

Increasing immigration might be the smart policy to implement in the short term, as it would help provide a much-needed tax base to stabilize pension funds and health care. But for most countries, it's not a prudent long-term plan. More than [95% of Western countries are in a state of overshoot](https://data.footprintnetwork.org/#/?). People often wonder why birth rates are so low in Western countries. The simple answer is that the cost of living is too expensive. But again, this is the reality BECAUSE we decided to use up all our available energy and material resources as quickly as possible without any considerations for civilizational sustainability. When cheap and abundant fossil fuels were discovered, we rushed to extract as much as we could, and we sold it on the global markets essentially at cost. We failed to price fossil fuels to guarantee civilization's longevity. The consequences were predictable. [We saw a 1:1 relationship between exponential population growth and exponential consumption of cheap fossil fuels.](https://imgur.com/a/yRc5FRW). 

Today we are facing the very predictable outcomes that come with pricing a scarce non-renewable energy source -fossil fuels- (the most energy-dense substance known to man) WAY BELOW its real cost and its real value to civilization. [The cost of oil has doubled since 1970. Here's the global Energy Returned on Investment \(EROI\) for oil.](https://imgur.com/a/sfCLeN9) This shows that in 1970, the EROI of oil peaked at 70 units of energy generated for every 1 unit of energy invested to extract those 70 units. If you average out the massive fluctuations created by boom and bust cycles, you get a net decrease in EROI from 42 in 1970 to 20 in 2012. Today the EROI is below 20. Most experts say that you can't run an industrialized civilization with an EROI of lower than 8. This is where we are headed in the next couple decades when we completely run out of easily accessible fossil fuels. [Here's a graph showing the main type of oil well opened in a given year, and the total amount of oil supply in each of those wells.](https://imgur.com/a/oy9UDMq) So as can you see, starting from the 1970s, easy to access onshore oil rigs were running out, and today the vast majority of new oil wells are extremely costly to set up and the oil is hard to extract (deep sea rigs, costing 1 billion+ each). This means you have to generate a bigger amount of energy to extract the same oil (it takes lots of energy to create all the steel and the concrete to create a deep sea oil rig). So not only is oil getting more costly to extract, but there's also less of it.

To bring this back to your original question. Yes, western countries are facing a demographic crisis, but it's a crisis that was created out of our own hubris in thinking that unrestricted economic and population growth wouldn't also come with consequences down the line. The reality is that our planet is in overshoot, [we are consuming more resources than the ecosphere is able to replenish, and we are producing waste that exceeds the natural assimilative capacities of the bio-sphere](https://youtu.be/o1vX03h7w9c). The only energy source that gave us the ability to overshoot was cheap fossil fuels. As this cheap source of energy gets used up, we are left in a state of exponential growth in global debt (mainly to finance the massive costs of extracting the expensive fossil fuel that's left), and a state of constant inflation. The result is a world where developed countries can no longer afford to live with the same energy consumption that was achieved in the previous decades. This is why birth rates are so low, it's one of many bio-physical negative feedbacks that's starting to kick in, to respond to our overshoot trajectory. 

For Europe to achieve sustainable levels it needs a lot fewer people, it also needs to reduce it's energy consumption. In an ideal world, where policies could be intentionally crafted to deal with overshoot, western countries would be massively investing in developing countries to build up their infrastructure to increase living standards and to reduce the pressures that incentivize high birth rates (like absolute poverty levels, seen in many areas of africa and asia). Ideally we would also have international standards for infrastructure and energy development to help guide developing countries towards a one-planet living model where every country could exist sustainably within the ecosphere to guarantee that civilization remains stable for thousands of years. 

Anyways sorry for the rant. 

**TLDR**: Yes immigration can help alleviate some of the short term stressors associated with low birth rates. But ultimately fixing the demographic crisis for good will require addressing the root cause. This means moving towards a global economic model based on bio-physical sustainability, not a model like we currently have that's based on constant growth within a finite planet. Sustainable civilizations keep resource use and population levels at a steady rate that's inline with the hard limits of the ecosphere. We are doing the opposite. The demographic crisis is just one of the first dominos at the very top of the [overshoot curve](https://imgur.com/a/DKchsnv). We are lucky that this seems to be our biggest overshoot related problem right now. If we don't take large scale action right now to address overshoot, the demographic crisis will be the least of our concerns.
