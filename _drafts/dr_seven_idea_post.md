What's funny is, I am an optimist too, by my own internal judgment.

An optimist in the sense that I can still see a clear path forward that doesn't totally lead to the dissolution of everything.

The problem is, the principal obstructions in the path are people like that who refuse to consider reality. In their defense, our entire culture is set up to deny reality and hide the challenges of daily life from the wealthy, so they don't have to think about it. It's not a surprise that multiple generations in, they have forgotten how to even do anything other than what they are already doing.

When I was younger, I discovered a .txt file of E.M. Forster's The Machine Stops on my family computer and was transfixed. That book is over a century old, but I am convinced the author was clairvoyant or something.

The way people just...do things without knowing why, because that's how they have always done it, is fucking eerie in 2021. So many things have changed around us, and people are desperately just trying to return to their last known point of stability. People need a vision of the future to work together, and they feel as though (1) the future promised is a lie in it's totality (2) nobody is acknowledging or admitting it. That is a dangerous spirit of the times at such a crucial moment.

"Optimism" in the usual sense, the kind that suspends logic, is a huge part of the modern world, and how they are able to keep people focused on everything except what matters. Realism has to replace it.

on the myth of progress



As someone with a bit of an interest in economics, and entirely too much unwilling exposure to corporate and government environments:

What we are seeing now is not unprecedented. We use artificial metrics like GDP and so on as shorthand for very complex underlying realities. The trouble is, mainstream economics focuses primarily on these metrics, and models using them, not on empirical studies of the real world: in fact, the field of "behavioral economics" exists almost as a direct opposite to the mainstream, showing how poorly it accounts for human factors and negative externalities.

Most politicians, economists, and people do not understand the Real World, as in, physics, energy flows, power sources, efficiency metrics, supply chains. All the invisible shit behind the curtain that those numbers allegedly provide a clear image of. But the numbers don't give a clear image, they give a totally artificial and self-serving one, based on axioms that directly conflict with physical laws if taken to their logical extremes. Constant growth at 2-3% per year as assumed by so, so many would result in absurd outcomes like the Earth consuming more energy than the Sun shines on it, in a timespan much shorter than some empires existed.

Not only is the usual story people believe about modernity and progress wrong, it's obviously, hilariously wrong in ways that schoolchildren can grasp. Many people still believe we are going to have a Star Trek future, because their understanding of science is so poor that they don't see how many fundamental laws are broken in those media depictions. It's magic, disguised as technology, but a worrying percentage of people view those portrayed futures as inevitable.

We live in a time where the Fake World has more or less subsumed the real one in the minds of most people. The indicators used inside the system won't ever forecast it's end. Just like Western intelligence agencies couldn't foresee the Soviet collapse because they were looking at trees, not the forest, our modern leaders are still obsessing at bits of moss and lichen while the forest is ablaze all around them.

It's already in progress. If we are lucky, they will bungle it so badly that globalism will break down entirely and emissions fall by sheer virtue of mass confusion and dismay. If industry remains organized and competent, it will guarantee the most catastrophic outcome.

Modern society worships itself, and more specifically, worships it's own grand narratives about progress, technology, human potential, and so on. As explicit religiosity trends downward, unacknowledged religiosity has reached stratospheric heights, it's just that we don't call it "religion", it's just "reality" for many people.

Some would use the term capitalist realism here, but I think it's deeper than that, given that many anticapitalists fall into this same trap. The idea that humans are special and somehow capable of conducting themselves in a way that brings the whole species to a better situation is the problem, because it's not true. We can rob the future of it's resources, or we can rob our neighbors of theirs to increase our own (or enslave them, as the inventors of cities would helpfully suggest to you). But that's it- once you run out of neighbors to rob, you have to steal from the future, and we are now exhausting our supply of that in both the metaphorical and literal senses.

Culture is stuck in a fucked-up loop of degenerating persistent repetition of phrases and themes because the bedrock for legitimate expressiveness and novelty has been mined away completely. We worship ourselves, but we are anything but divine, and what does it say about us that we could look at the world, such as it is, and conclude that our systems are in any way praiseworthy? You have to check your eyeballs at the door to get along in this society if you are a working person, and most of us never remember to retrieve our eyeballs from the fellow with the paper slips. We just leave them there because it's easier to let other people decide what's in front of us by blind consensus.
