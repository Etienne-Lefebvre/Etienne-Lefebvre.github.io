#Problems
* Decrease in the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) of global energy supplies
    * Mainly caused by rapidly decreasing supply of easily accessible sources of fossil fuels
* Exponential increase in global debt
    * Little to no global effort to reduce mounting debt levels
* Global Topsoil erosion threating the stability of food supplies
* Economic Sustainability Paradox:
    * those who choose to lower their rate of growth/consumption (whether as an individual, a corporation, a government) end up lowering the degree of political power they can reach, creating a sort of political paradox: enacting legislation/policies that lowers our rate of consumption/overshoot diminishes the political power you have relative to those who follow business as usual logic, diminishing your ability to change system-level governance/economic systems. 
* Erosion of democratic institutions

#Solutions
* All airlines must sell flight tickets at a base price per km travelled (to incentivize less carbon intensive travel)
* Federal International Governance 
    * Enforce financial penalties for pollution and emissions
* Fossil fuel consumption tax
