Welcome to the Carbon Pulse. A brief period in human history where our societal hubris convinced us that the laws of the biosphere, like carrying capacity, do not affect us.I decided to start with the population line because it's a strong image that clearly shows the unsustainability of our trajectory. There are simply no population graphs like this, of any living species, that isnt followed with a proportionally precipitous decline. For thousands of years, the human population was fairly stable at <100 million humans, and within the span of a geological eye-blink, we are now pushing towards 9 billion humans.

For most of that time we lived in synergy with our life-giving ecosystems, and we took part in maintaining what are called complete ecosystems. Complete ecosystems have a carefully calibrated number Macro-consumers (animals and humans) that selfproduce by consuming plants or other macroconsumers, and micro-consumers self-produce by decomposing the bodies of both plants and animals and returning nutrients to the soil so the cycle can repeat continuously. Importantly these complete ecosystems are able to maintain themselves and thrive indefinitely by continuously transforming and recycling matter and assimilating waste.

But today, humans no longer live in complete ecosystems. Instead, we sustain ourselves by consuming, not other plants or other macroconsumers, but by consuming vast reserves of carbon sequestered over hundreds of millions of years in just a few centuries. But the problem is that our biosphere is not able to recycle this massive amount of waste product generated by our consumption of fossil fuels. Co2 being the biggest waste product in terms of net weight.

Our recent discovery of flammable rock and liquid in the form of oil, coal, and natural gas has temporarily turbocharged humanity’s energy use. Just in the last 100 years, we went from a global energy metabolism of 3 terra watts to a global energy metabolism of >25 terawatts. This has allowed us to exponentially grow our population and enter what ecologists call a state of overshoot.

Ecological-overshoot exists when the consumption of bioresources and the production of wastes exceed the regenerative and assimilative capacities respectively, of supportive ecosystems. When in EO, we can achieve further growth only by depleting essential natural capital and overtaxing the life-support functions of the ecosphere including the climate system, i.e., by destroy by destroying the biophysical basis of our own existence.

This this is why i like the term Carbon pulse to describe our current predicament. Because it’s a very brief period of time in our history where we utilized massive amounts of carbon, creating vasts amounts of energy in a short period of time, a short pulse.

Humans are reaching the end of the carbon pulse, we are somewhere between the red and blue. Now we face a time of degrowth in energy, in complexity, in population, in consumption that requires a quality of “systems thinking” and future planning never before required of our species.

Apart from climate change, the obvious reason why we are likely to come down the carbon pulse as fast as we came up is due to the finite supply of what helped us climb fast in the first place, namely the finite supply of fossil fuels, and the impossibility of substituting fossil fuels with other energy sources for the same cost and for the same energy density.

What will our civilization look like in the near future when we are forced to dedicate a larger and larger share of our economy simply to extract energy? Will our increasingly polarized and divided governance systems be able to withstand constant inflation, cuts to essential public services, and economic degrowth? We will be able to come down the otherside of the carbon pulse with some semblance of industrial civilization still left standing?
