# What Fuels our streets

Energy. 
![Population + Fossil fuel energy](\img\posts\world-population-and-fuel-use.png)

Increasing immigration might be the smart policy to implement in the short term, as it would help provide a much-needed tax base to stabilize pension funds and health care. But for most countries, it's not a prudent long-term plan. More than [95% of Western countries are in a state of overshoot](https://data.footprintnetwork.org/#/?). People often wonder why birth rates are so low in Western countries. The simple answer is that the cost of living is too expensive. But again, this is the reality BECAUSE we decided to use up all our available energy and material resources as quickly as possible without any considerations for civilizational sustainability. When cheap and abundant fossil fuels were discovered, we rushed to extract as much as we could, and we sold it on the global markets essentially at cost. We failed to price fossil fuels to guarantee civilization's longevity. The consequences were predictable. [We saw a 1:1 relationship between exponential population growth and exponential consumption of cheap fossil fuels.](https://imgur.com/a/yRc5FRW).
