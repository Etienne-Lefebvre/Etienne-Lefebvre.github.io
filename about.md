Hi there! I made this site primarily for my own sake. I wanted to create a space where I could easily find all the resources i've read in the past regarding the global predicament we find ourselves in, and what to do about it. The website is still under construction, I'm quite busy at the moment so I never had time to properly finish it. 

A bit about me. 

I have a deep seated reluctance to blindly trust any source of knowledge/authority without first investigaging the issue in depth myself. Overtime this has led me to dedicate a relatively large portion of my time to researching what I call my "rabbit holes". While not all of these "rabbit holes" are related to our global predicament, a significant amount of them do converge on the topic. And so my goal for this website is to demonstrate the scope of the meta-crisis through the lense of my rabbit holes. You might be curious about what rabbit holes I have explored so far. Well my formal rabbit hole (my educational background) is cognitive-neuroscience. While in grad school I mostly did foundational research pertaining to the functional connectivity networks involved in memory processes. My research methods mainly involved data analysis using fMRI and EEG. As you might expect from such an educational backgroud, I have also extensively explored the philosophy of mind and psychological literature. My informal education is constantly expanding. So far these informal rabbit holes include: Urbanism (zoning laws, parking reform, single staircase reform), Thermodynamics, Climate Change, History of Education, Ufology, Abiogenis, Evolutionary Linguistics, Population ecology, IR theory.
