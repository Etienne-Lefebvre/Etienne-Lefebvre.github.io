# June 2024 (Report - Institute for Economics and Peace)
- **[Global Peace Index 2024](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GPI-2024-web.pdf?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)**
    - **Note**: The well known Global Peace Index report was just published last week. They conclude that we have now the most amount of active conflicts since WW2
    - **Quotes**: _There are currently 56 active conflicts, the most since the end of Second World War, and with fewer conflicts being resolved, either militarily or through peace agreements. The number of conflicts that ended in a decisive victory fell from 49 per cent in the 1970s to nine per cent in the 2010s, while conflicts that ended through peace agreements fell from 23 per cent to four per cent over the same period._ 
    - **Quotes**: _The world has become less stable in the past 17 years with substantial increases in political instability, number of conflicts, deaths from conflicts and violent demonstrations_ 

# June 2024 (Database)
- **[Collapsology Database](https://www.collapsology.info/en/science/)**
    - Collapsology.info is a portal of documentary resources edited and maintained by a collective at the initiative of Pablo Servigne and Raphaël Stevens. It hosts bib.collapse, an open-access scientific database with over 9000 articles, and offers a selection of links and books for anyone caring for our common future.
    - The database is structured in four main categories of keywords:
        - General discussions
            - Limits to growth (discussions & theories of societal collapse and limits to growth)
            - Existential risks (discussions & theories of existential risks)
            - Post-normal science (TEK, uncertainty, governance, etc.)
        - Overshoots & vulnerabilities
            - Planetary boundaries (climate, biodiversity, acidification, pollution, water, etc.)
            - Physical limits (energy sources, critical metal & minerals, cabon budget, etc.)
            - Lock-ins (socio-technical, cognitive, behavioural, rebound effect, etc.)
            - Systemic risks (finance, infrastructure, supply chain, telecouplings, etc.)
        - Horsemen of the apocalypse
            - Violence, conflicts and wars (migrations, climate, resources, etc.)
            - Health, diseases and pandemics (COVID-19, climate, biodiversity, etc.)
            - Agriculture, food, famine (breadbasket failure, conflicts, seeds, etc.)
            - Disasters (Extreme climate events, nuclear fallout, etc.)
        - Human and social sciences
            - Psychology (fear, denial, grief, hope, etc.)
            - Political science (governance, activism, failed states, inequality, etc.)
            - History (USSR, Rapa-Nui, Rome, etc.)
            - Etc. (demography, geopolitics, sociology, philosophy, etc.)
 
# June 2023 (Academic Article - Nature Sustainability - Impact Factor 25 )
- **[Earlier collapse of Anthropocene ecosystems driven by multiple faster and noisier drivers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-023-01157-x)**
    - _A major concern for the world’s ecosystems is the possibility of collapse, where landscapes and the societies they support change abruptly. Accelerating stress levels, increasing frequencies of extreme events and strengthening intersystem connections suggest that conventional modelling approaches based on incremental changes in a single stress may provide poor estimates of the impact of climate and human activities on ecosystems. We conduct experiments on four models that simulate abrupt changes in the Chilika lagoon fishery, the Easter Island community, forest dieback and lake water quality—representing ecosystems with a range of anthropogenic interactions. Collapses occur sooner under increasing levels of primary stress but additional stresses and/or the inclusion of noise in all four models bring the collapses substantially closer to today by ~38–81%. We discuss the implications for further research and the need for humanity to be vigilant for signs that ecosystems are degrading even more rapidly than previously thought._

# April 2023
- **[Effects of Plastics on Human Health](https://annalsofglobalhealth.org/articles/10.5334/aogh.4056)**
	- Comprehensive Review Paper that examined the impacts plastics have on (1) human health and well-being; (2) the global environment, especially the ocean; (3) the economy; and (4) vulnerable populations.
    - **Plastic Recycling:** _Plastic disposal is highly inefficient, with **recovery and recycling rates below 10% globally**. The result is that an estimated 22 Mt of plastic waste enters the environment each year, much of it single-use plastic and are added to the more than 6 gigatons of plastic waste that have accumulated since 1950._ 
    - **Conclusions:** _It is now clear that current patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal are **not sustainable** and are responsible for significant harms to human health, the environment, and the economy as well as for deep societal injustices. The main driver of these worsening harms is an almost exponential and still accelerating increase in **global plastic production**. The thousands of chemicals in plastics—monomers, additives, processing agents, and non-intentionally added substances—include amongst their number known human carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, neurotoxicants, and persistent organic pollutants. These chemicals are responsible for many of plastics’ known harms to human and planetary health. The chemicals leach out of plastics, enter the environment, cause pollution, and result in human exposure and disease. All efforts to reduce plastics’ hazards must address the hazards of plastic-associated chemicals._
        - **Note:** It's good to see a direct aknowledgement that the real problem is simply our current levels of plastic consumption/production. Recyling is utterly incapable of solving the civilizational threat that plastics pose. We need to drastically reduce plastic production. Ideally plastic should only be used for essential services. 50% of all plastic today is used for packaging, using plastic in this way should be banned, or priced according to the real costs that plastic packaging externalizes. 
    - **Recommendations:** _This Commission urges that a cap on global plastic production with targets, timetables, and national contributions be a central provision of the Global Plastics Treaty. We recommend inclusion of the following additional provisions:_
        - _Banning or severely restricting manufacture and use of unnecessary, avoidable, and problematic plastic items, especially single-use items such as manufactured plastic microbeads._
        - _Make fossil carbon producers, plastic producers, and the manufacturers of plastic products legally and financially responsible for the safety and end-of-life management of all the materials they produce and sell._
        - _Mandate reductions in the chemical complexity of plastic products; health-protective standards for plastics and plastic additives; a requirement for use of sustainable non-toxic materials; full disclosure of all components; and traceability of components._
