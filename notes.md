# April 2023
- **[Effects of Plastics on Human Health](https://annalsofglobalhealth.org/articles/10.5334/aogh.4056)**
	- Comprehensive Review Paper that examined the impacts plastics have on (1) human health and well-being; (2) the global environment, especially the ocean; (3) the economy; and (4) vulnerable populations.
    - **Plastic Recycling:** _Plastic disposal is highly inefficient, with **recovery and recycling rates below 10% globally**. The result is that an estimated 22 Mt of plastic waste enters the environment each year, much of it single-use plastic and are added to the more than 6 gigatons of plastic waste that have accumulated since 1950._ 
    - **Conclusions:** _It is now clear that current patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal are **not sustainable** and are responsible for significant harms to human health, the environment, and the economy as well as for deep societal injustices. The main driver of these worsening harms is an almost exponential and still accelerating increase in **global plastic production**. The thousands of chemicals in plastics—monomers, additives, processing agents, and non-intentionally added substances—include amongst their number known human carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, neurotoxicants, and persistent organic pollutants. These chemicals are responsible for many of plastics’ known harms to human and planetary health. The chemicals leach out of plastics, enter the environment, cause pollution, and result in human exposure and disease. All efforts to reduce plastics’ hazards must address the hazards of plastic-associated chemicals._
        - **Note:** It's good to see a direct aknowledgement that the real problem is simply our current levels of plastic consumption/production. Recyling is utterly incapable of solving the civilizational threat that plastics pose. We need to drastically reduce plastic production. Ideally plastic should only be used for essential services. 50% of all plastic today is used for packaging, using plastic in this way should be banned, or priced according to the real costs that plastic packaging externalizes. 
    - **Recommendations:** _This Commission urges that a cap on global plastic production with targets, timetables, and national contributions be a central provision of the Global Plastics Treaty. We recommend inclusion of the following additional provisions:_
        - _Banning or severely restricting manufacture and use of unnecessary, avoidable, and problematic plastic items, especially single-use items such as manufactured plastic microbeads._
        - _Make fossil carbon producers, plastic producers, and the manufacturers of plastic products legally and financially responsible for the safety and end-of-life management of all the materials they produce and sell._
        - _Mandate reductions in the chemical complexity of plastic products; health-protective standards for plastics and plastic additives; a requirement for use of sustainable non-toxic materials; full disclosure of all components; and traceability of components._
