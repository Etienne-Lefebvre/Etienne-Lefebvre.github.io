<details>
<summary style="font-size: 1.3em;">Global Peace Index</summary>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><a href="https://www.visionofhumanity.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GPI-2024-web.pdf?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email"><strong>Link To Report</strong></a></li>
  <li><strong>Published:</strong> 2024</li>
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;">The well-known Global Peace Index report concluded that we have now the most amount of active conflicts since WW2.</li>
  ---
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Quotes:</strong></li> 
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><em>There are currently 56 active conflicts, the most since the end of Second World War, and with fewer conflicts being resolved, either militarily or through peace agreements. The number of conflicts that ended in a decisive victory fell from 49 per cent in the 1970s to nine per cent in the 2010s, while conflicts that ended through peace agreements fell from 23 per cent to four per cent over the same period.</em></li>
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><em>The world has become less stable in the past 17 years with substantial increases in political instability, number of conflicts, deaths from conflicts and violent demonstrations.</em></li>

<summary style="font-size: 1.3em;">Disruptions on the Horizon</summary>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><a href="https://horizons.service.canada.ca/en/2024/disruptions/index.shtml#report"><strong>Link To Report</strong></a></li>
  <li><strong>Published:</strong> 2024</li>
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"> This is a Canadian government report from Policy Horizons Canada (a goverment run think-thank that reports to the minister of employment). Their primary audience is bureaucrats in other canadian goverment departments. They essentially try to accurately assess civilizational risks factors that would have policy implications for the canadian governemnt. So far it seems like they have substantial political independence, and therefore they manage to publish fairly accurate reports, that in other countries would often get classified out fear that such honesty would frighten the public.</li>
  ---
  <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong></li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><em>What could the future look like if Canadians cannot meet their basic needs? Or if the healthcare system collapses, democracies break down globally, or cyberattacks regularly disrupt everyday life? What if these disruptions occur at the same time, creating a perfect storm and a unique set of combined circumstances for Canada to face?</em></li>
  
  <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><em>More than ever, the world is filled with uncertainty and unpredictability. A disruption’s impact could depend on the scale and speed with which it occurs, and how it interacts with other disruptions. Being aware of possible future disruptions and prepared for various scenarios can help mitigate risk and help anticipate what is on the horizon. While the disruptions in this report are not guaranteed to take place, they are plausible—and overlooking them may carry risks in various policy areas.</em></li>
  
  <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><em>These disruptions can help decision-makers think through what could occur and prepare for a wide range of possibilities. They can also facilitate conversation about policy, decision making, and how these situations might play out. Foresight and conversations about future disruptions can help Canada’s leaders identify challenges, harness possibilities, and create resilient, sustainable policy in the face of the unexpected.</em></li>

<summary style="font-size: 1.3em;">Effects of Plastics on Human Health</summary>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><a href="https://annalsofglobalhealth.org/articles/10.5334/aogh.4056"><strong>Link To Article</strong></a></li>
  <li><strong>Published:</strong> 2023</li>
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;">Comprehensive Review Paper that examined the impacts plastics have on (1) human health and well-being; (2) the global environment, especially the ocean; (3) the economy; and (4) vulnerable populations.</li>
  ---
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Plastic Recycling:</strong></li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><em>Plastic disposal is highly inefficient, with <strong>recovery and recycling rates below 10% globally</strong>. The result is that an estimated 22 Mt of plastic waste enters the environment each year, much of it single-use plastic and are added to the more than 6 gigatons of plastic waste that have accumulated since 1950.</em></li>
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Conclusions:</strong></li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><em>It is now clear that current patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal are <strong>not sustainable</strong> and are responsible for significant harms to human health, the environment, and the economy as well as for deep societal injustices. The main driver of these worsening harms is an almost exponential and still accelerating increase in <strong>global plastic production</strong>. The thousands of chemicals in plastics—monomers, additives, processing agents, and non-intentionally added substances—include amongst their number known human carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, neurotoxicants, and persistent organic pollutants. These chemicals are responsible for many of plastics’ known harms to human and planetary health. The chemicals leach out of plastics, enter the environment, cause pollution, and result in human exposure and disease. All efforts to reduce plastics’ hazards must address the hazards of plastic-associated chemicals.</em></li>
  <li style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Note:</strong> It's good to see a direct acknowledgment that the real problem is simply our current levels of plastic consumption/production. Recycling is utterly incapable of solving the civilizational threat that plastics pose. We need to drastically reduce plastic production. Ideally, plastic should only be used for essential services. 50% of all plastic today is used for packaging, using plastic in this way should be banned, or priced according to the real costs that plastic packaging externalizes.</li>
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Recommendations:</strong></li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><em>This Commission urges that a cap on global plastic production with targets, timetables, and national contributions be a central provision of the Global Plastics Treaty. We recommend inclusion of the following additional provisions:</em></li>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 20px;">
    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><em>Banning or severely restricting manufacture and use of unnecessary, avoidable, and problematic plastic items, especially single-use items such as manufactured plastic microbeads.</em></li>
    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><em>Make fossil carbon producers, plastic producers, and the manufacturers of plastic products legally and financially responsible for the safety and end-of-life management of all the materials they produce and sell.</em></li>
    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><em>Mandate reductions in the chemical complexity of plastic products; health-protective standards for plastics and plastic additives; a requirement for use of sustainable non-toxic materials; full disclosure of all components; and traceability of components.</em></li>

<summary style="font-size: 1.3em;">Earlier collapse of Anthropocene ecosystems driven by multiple faster and noisier drivers</summary>

  <li><strong>Quote:</strong></li>
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><em>A major concern for the world’s ecosystems is the possibility of collapse, where landscapes and the societies they support change abruptly. Accelerating stress levels, increasing frequencies of extreme events and strengthening intersystem connections suggest that conventional modelling approaches based on incremental changes in a single stress may provide poor estimates of the impact of climate and human activities on ecosystems. We conduct experiments on four models that simulate abrupt changes in the Chilika lagoon fishery, the Easter Island community, forest dieback and lake water quality—representing ecosystems with a range of anthropogenic interactions. Collapses occur sooner under increasing levels of primary stress but additional stresses and/or the inclusion of noise in all four models bring the collapses substantially closer to today by ~38–81%. We discuss the implications for further research and the need for humanity to be vigilant for signs that ecosystems are degrading even more rapidly than previously thought.</em></li>

  <li><strong>Quote:</strong></li>
  <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><em>City administrations seem preoccupied with such marginally useful things as greener buildings, reduced carbonemissions from engineering operations, better public transit,enhanced green space, and “smarter traffic” control all of which ironically, makes them moreattractive to investment and growth. The circular economy (not wholly possible) and green growth (an oxymoron) are popular if somewhat delusional concepts for a society in overshoot. Certainly no city planning department has yet announced a scheme for the equitable contraction of the city’s operations, the downsizing of its economy or the dispersal of its population. It is safe to say that no city or megacity on earth is remotely sustainable or even in managed control of its supportive ecosystems. On its present “developmental” path, global civilization is destined to have an interesting encounter with biophysical reality.</em></li>
